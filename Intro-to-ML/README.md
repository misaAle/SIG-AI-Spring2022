# Welcome to the first SIG AI workshop of the semester!
### Here, we'll go over a quick tutorial on setting up Jupyter notebook and working with a dataset.

## Anaconda

1. First, check if you've already installed Anaconda by opening a command prompt and typing conda
2. If you don't have it installed, then go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual to install anaconda based on your OS
3. If you have python installed, but not through Anaconda, then open a command prompt and type **pip install jupyter**
4. Once you've got jupyter installed, we're also going to need other modules
5. Anaconda comes with most of the modules needed for machine learning, which are *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *numpy*, and *scikit-learn*.
6. Using pip install, we can install these modules by running **pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn**
7. Now, launch jupyter notebook by going to anaconda navigator and launch jupyter notebook, or typing **jupyter notebook** in command prompt
